<h3> <u>Ingredients</u> </h3>
<ul> <li>02 boneless, skinless, chicken breasts (cut into very small pieces) </li>
    <li> 2 tablespoon butter </li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
    <li> 03 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
    <li> ½ onion (diced) </li>
    <li> 03 tablespoon ketchup </li>
    <li> 01 tablespoon mustard </li>
    <li> 01 cup heavy cream (or one can of table cream) </li>
    <li> salt to taste </li>
    <li> 1 4oz can sliced mushrooms (optional)</li>
    <li> ¼ cup tomato sauce (optional) </li>
</ul>
<h3> <u> Steps </u> </h3>
<ol>
    <li> Sprinkle salt over the chicken and set aside.</li>
    <li> In a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium-high heat and add the olive oil; wait until it's hot and 
        add chicken in a single layer. Don't disturb it until it starts to sear. Push it all to one side when pieces get some color 
        and add 1 tablespoon of butter, onion, and garlic to the empty side. Saute onion and garlic until onion is translucent..</li>    
    <li> Add heavy cream, ketchup, mustard, soy sauce, and canned mushrooms (if using). Mix everything..</li>
    <li> Check if the chicken is done; if it's not, lower the heat, cover the pan, and, let it cook for a bit longer 
        (until no longer pink inside, or thermometer registers 165ºF or 73˚C)</li>
    <li> Once the chicken is cooked but still soft and moist (don't over-cook it, or it will be hard and dry), turn off the heat and try it.
         Correct salt if necessary, and if you like it more acidic, add ¼ cup of tomato sauce..</li>
    <li> Enjoy it over rice, along with some potato sticks (Batata Palha).</li>
    </ol>
    <h2> ENJOY</h2>
